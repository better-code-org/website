        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Better Code is an idea that has been ruminating on Pete Shepley's mind for a while. It is an
            an attempt to understand what it means to write better code. It stems from the continuous improvement
            practice that is being seen in industry today.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is going to be a collection of resources and ideas that could help to improve how we
            think about code and programming and systems. It is a constant work in progress, as all
            good things can be.
        </p>

        <h2>Who</h2>
        <p>
            Pete Shepley is a software engineer, systems analyst, and creative worker. You can find more about him on
            <a href="https://peteshepley.com">his website</a>. He is starting this site to bring together resources on
            refocusing how programmers write code. To limit biases, he is going to  offset his personal beliefs and
            biases by bringing in others to share their perspective. This community is about open discourse and learning
            from each other.
        </p>

        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>
            This website is going to collect articles, interviews, and other resources to help foster the
            idea that we are constantly trying to write better code. It is the hope to define and refine
            what that means and how we can do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually there will be links to articles or resource collections. And we will host videos of interviews
            or discussions around better code. There will also be the chance to have in person meetings with
            group discussions. The sky is the limit.
